<p class="aboutMe">
I began my career with an early interest in sewing, knitting, cooking and different crafts. I learned it all from my mother and grandmother, who used to make everything at home. I remember that when my grandmother tried to teach me how to crochet, I thought it was an "old people thing." I was young at that time and didn't want to learn, but I still did so by watching them sew, knit and cook.  
</p>
<p class="aboutMe">	
I was slowly acquiring all these skills without noticing, until I finally had the chance to put them into practice when I got married. I started sewing my own clothes and once my kids were born, I started making their clothes while they were growing up. Although that wasn't my passion at the time, I enjoyed doing it, yet I always had the idea in my mind of breaking the routine of the house. 
</p>
<p class="aboutMe">
My kids were always my inspiration and in order to encourage them to learn constantly, I had to do the same. So I began taking classes in decorative painting,  something that had always captivated me, and I became a member of the Society of Decorative Painters. 
</p>
<p class="aboutMe">
I also wanted to cook healthy for my family. Cooking and painting became my leisure time activities. In special events, my whole family would gather in my house, me being the hostess and event planner. I would organize everything for 25 to 30 people. I enjoyed sharing my skills with my family a lot, as well as eating healthy with them.

My mom is a wonderful cook and I learned a lot from her, but it wasn't until I had the need to prepare food for my kids and husband that I recalled what she had taught me and I started sharing recipes and secrets with her.  
</p>
<p class="aboutMe">
In 2005 I started learning how to paint in watercolor from a renowned watercolor artist, Jamie Cordero. 2007, I started learning how to make greeting cards and I became a Stampin' Up demonstrator. These two latest additions to my repertoire made me open up this website and share my skills with all of you.
